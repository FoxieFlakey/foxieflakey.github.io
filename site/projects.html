          This is a POSIX 2008 compliant library for C, it contains
          different kinds of data structures, features and functions.
          It's currently used for deduplicating common stuffs like log
          management, wrapper around Pthread's mutexes, conds, barriers,
          etc as it really painful that because I can't just call
          <code>pthread_*_destroy</code> and have it no-op if it isn't
          initialized yet.

          There are nice data structures such as linked list, array list,
          queues, etc. Those data structures are abstracted too with
          interfaces. The interfaces also tries to have as much default
          implementation as possible to have fallback for an operation
          if it isn't explicitly implemented even if its not optimal.
