      <summary><time datetime="2024-04-05">Friday, 5 April 2024</time>: Does C23 header exists?</summary>
      <p>
        Currently Flup unconditionally uses bundled headers which recently
        added by C23. The unconditionally uses bundled headers is exist when
        I was initially added the use of stdbit.h and stdckint.h because it
        was appealing to me when I saw the draft of things C23 added. stdbit.h
        is an easy standard header for dealing with bits so Foxie don't have
        to implement the C23 things and use standard provided not my paw written
        one which may be as well buggy in some edge case which this cute fox
        couldn't thought at the time of writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        My plan is to have KConfig hidden options <code>HAS_STDCKINT</code>
        and <code>HAS_STDBIT</code> options. And then set that based on my
        feature of shell exec as Foxie named it :3 so the KConfig in c23_support/
        has this now.
        <pre>
          <code>
menu "C23 support"
config HAS_STDBIT
  bool
  default $[[$PROJECT_DIR/scripts/check_header.sh stdbit.h]]
config HAS_STDCKINT
  bool
  default $[[$PROJECT_DIR/scripts/check_header.sh stdckint.h]]
          </code>
        </pre>
        Where <code>$[[...]]</code> is just like shell's <code>$(...)</code>
        but instead <code>(...)</code> Foxie used Lua's multiline syntax. It
        basicly runs the shell and captures its output and replace it with
        the output so if <code>check_header.sh</code> outputs "y". It will
        be replaced with "y" so kconfig command only sees <code>default y</code>
        and does not care about the syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the <code>HAS_{HAS_STDBIT,HAS_STDCKINT}</code> computed next is
        the user selectable config whether to use bundled one or not
        and it nicely defaults to "n" if the system already has the header
        or "y" if the system doesn't. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Next is of course the Makefile part which conditionally adds proper
        <code>-isystem</code> flag to corresponding subdir in c23_support/
        to match the enabled bundle.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here this what Foxie has to say about the auto detect. Which is
        nice isn't it UwU
