    <h1>How Foxie made her Alpine packages</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      There always an inevitable need to have a seperate environment for sole of
      building packages to avoid relying on some dependency Foxie didn't know.
    </p>
    
    <h2>2. A bit about container</h2>
    <p>
      So Foxie decided that chroot like is the best option costing no resources when
      she is not actively building/compiling something and easy entry by running
      a shell script to set-up minimum necessary pseudo filesystems. First thing
      is there not much of one simple script to install a base Alpine (atleast
      one which Foxie liked) to a directory.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Foxie also thinks the best way to do it is to use namespaces to create isolated
      "container" much like Docker but simpler for the purpose of building Alpine
      packages or you could call that "mini Docker" UwU. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Foxie's idea is to reserve 200 UID and GID from host to be used in the
      container and map those correspondingly to the 0 to 1999 in the user namespace.
    </p>
    
    <h2>3. Reserving resources on host</h2>
    <p>
      First Foxie has to reserve those UID and GID on the host before using it so
      new packages/update on the host can't accidentally used those UID and GID.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are package named <code>shadow-subids</code> which is used to maintain
      ranges of UID and GID allocated for a user. It manage those ranges in
      <code>/etc/subuid</code> and <code>/etc/subgid</code>. The way to activate it
      is using <code>newuidmap</code> and <code>newgidmap</code> which sets a new
      UID and GID map on the process with specified PID. Foxie going to use it
      indirectly from <code>unshare</code> command. What <code>unshared</code> does
      is run a new process with new set of namespaces
    </p>
    <p>
      To reserve, Foxie need to use <code>usermod</code>'s <code>--add-subuids</code>
      flag and <code>--add-subgids</code> flag to add both UID and GID ranges needed.
      The command to do it is (Foxie wanted to reserved 2000 until 3999 or 2000 IDs)
      <pre><code>#!/bin/sh
usermod foxie --add-subuids 2000-3999 --add-subgids 2000-3999
</code></pre>
      To use its simply <code>unshare --map-groups=auto --map-users=auto</code> and
      unshare will automically use first block of UID and GID which maps to namespace's
      UID/GID 0 until the whatever amount you allocated^w^
    </p>
    
    <h2>4. Some preparations</h2>
    <p>
      Starting namespace into empty directory surely won't achieve anything -w- So
      lets copy our host's <code>apk.static</code> and its associated accompanying
      signature at <code>/sbin/apk.static</code> and the signatures to <code>/etc/apk/keys</code>
      (because APK need it to verify if the package came from trusted distributor or not)
      to the container's temporary directory (Foxie going to get rid of it after setting
      up because the static is not needed anymore). After that it also need few directories
      like <code>/proc</code> and <code>/dev/pts</code> which is empty but will be
      mounted later in the namespace and it will be hidden to anything but namespace
      itself so don't be surprise that those empty after mounting ^w^. And there also
      <code>/tmp</code> for temporary files and its self explanatory what it does
    </p>
    <p>
      Alpine Package Keeper (APK) the package manager for Alpine needs few files to work
      properly and they are <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> and <code>/etc/apk/repositories</code>.
      The <code>resolv.conf</code> file is used so APK and other network accessing
      know where to search when they are resolving domain names. The file contains IP to
      nameserver to search domain names which more commonly known as DNS server/resolver
    </p>
    <p>
      Foxie copies the host's <code>resolv.conf</code> and generate a new <code>repositories</code>
      filled with main, community and testing repository (I know what I'm doing with
      testing repository lol) generated from a link
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the container's directory should look like
      <pre>rootfs_x86_64/
├── dev
│   └── pts
├── etc
│   ├── apk
│   │   ├── respositories
│   │   └── keys
│   │       └── alpine-devel@lists.alpinelinux.org-6165ee59.rsa.pub
│   └── resolv.conf
├── proc
├── tmp
│   └── apk.static
├── sbin
└── sys

7 directories, 4 files
</pre>
    </p>
    
    <h2>5. Entering the namespace</h2>
    <p>
      Foxie can enter the namespace using <code>unshare</code> command which
      create new namespaces and run a command
      <pre><code>unshare \
  --map-root-user --map-users=auto --map-groups=auto \
  --wd="$root_dir" --root="$root_dir" \
   \
  --mount --propagation=private --mount-proc=/proc \
  --pid --fork \
  --uts --ipc --cgroup --time \
   \
  &gt;whatever command&lt;
</code></pre>
      Thats a hug chunk of pasted code -w- So lets Foxie break it :3
      First there <code>--map-root-user --map-users=auto --map-groups=auto</code>
      which mentioned earlier which auto maps first blocks the current user has
      access to and <code>--map-root-user</code> will make sure the process ran
      by the <code>unshare</code> is a root user atleast in that user namespace
    </p>
    <p>
      Next <code>--wd="$root_dir" --root="$root_dir"</code> flags automatically
      make the namespace chdir and then chroot into that directory preventing
      escapes to the host ^w^
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>--mount --propagation=private --mount-proc=/proc</code> prepares
      a mount namespace in a private mode which mean any mount happening inside
      won't be visible to others and <code>--mount-proc=/proc</code> mounts the
      <code>/proc</code> in the container's mount namespace. You know what the
      <code>/proc</code> for so Foxie won't explain it ^w^
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>--pid --fork</code> these flags create a new PID namespace which
      essentially like new PID tree all begin at 1 once again to the namespace
      but on host its ordinary process and the <code>--fork</code> is needed for
      PID namespace to work. The command will be executed as PID 1 in that namespace
    </p>
    <p>
      Last but not much of detail UwU which is <code>--uts --ipc --cgroup --time</code>.
      Those simply just create new instance of UTS, IPC, CGroup and time namespace.
      For each of them
      <ol>
        <li>
          UTS: Create a new view on the hostname and nodename
          and stuffs related to <code>uname</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          IPC: Create new namespace for System V IPC objects so progams
          in the namespace don't know and can't talk to the host with
          Sytstem V IPC objects such as shmem, mqueues, semaphores and etc
        </li>
        <li>
          CGroup: It create new CGroup tree where the contain can further
          divide its own available resources using CGroup without needed
          the host's intervention to do modification to host's CGroup tree.
        </li>
        <li>
          Time: It basicly just dealing with creating new view on monotonic times
          and boot times so it looked different to the container than it is to the
          host
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h2>6. Install the alpine-base</h2>
    <p>
      This is much simple, Foxie just reusing previous command and run <code>/tmp/apk.static --update-cache --no-check-certificate --initdb add alpine-base</code>.
      <code>--update-cache</code> flag and <code>--initdb</code> simply ask the APK to
      initialize APK databases and do update cache because there nothing -w- The last flag
      which is <code>--no-check-certificate</code> essentially disable SSL certificates
      checking because there is no CA certificates yet. Apparently <code>--allow-untrusted</code>
      also needed but Foxie don't know why it didnt pick up copied signature at <code>/etc/apk/keys</code>
    </p>
    
    <h2>7. Cleaning up</h2>
    <p>
      Cleaning up is much simple. Foxie just have to delete the host copy of apk.static
      and its signatures as APK already installed in the container. So its done ^w^
      Foxie has installed Alpine in container
